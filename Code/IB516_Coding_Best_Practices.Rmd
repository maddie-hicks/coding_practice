IB 516 Analytical Workflows
Coding Demonstration - Coding Best Practices

Clear the workspace and close all graphic devices (two right panels in RStudio).

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
graphics.off()
```

Generate some data.
x is an independent variable

```{r}
x <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

z is noise

```{r}
z <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

y is equation

```{r}
y <- 2.2 * x + 1.1 + z
```

Plot the equation.

```{r}
plot(x, y)
```
